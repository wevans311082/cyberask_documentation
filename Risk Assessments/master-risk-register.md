## Monitoring and Escalation

- High risks (score ≥ 12) require monthly progress updates and evidence of control effectiveness.
- Medium risks (score 6–10) are reviewed quarterly; low risks (score ≤ 5) annually unless triggered earlier by incidents or changes.
- Any increase in likelihood or impact triggers an ad-hoc review and potential escalation to clients where commitments are affected.

## Evidence Management

- Supporting documents (policies, configurations, screenshots, contracts) stored within the secure document repository with access controlled via Microsoft 365 permissions.
- Retention of risk records for at least six years to meet regulatory and contractual requirements.
