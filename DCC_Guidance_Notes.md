## Level 0 – Foundational Cyber Hygiene

Level 0 focuses on Cyber Essentials alignment, basic GDPR compliance, and foundational network resilience. Expect to provide simple attestations, policies, and high-level diagrams.

| Control ID | Brief Description | Expected Evidence | Explanation |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------|

| 2314 – Ensure UK GDPR Compliance (L0–L3) | Policies and procedures for GDPR compliance, including data subject risk assessments. | GDPR policies/procedures; DPIAs; risk assessments/registers tailored to organisation size. | Policies must outline data handling practices. Assessors verify risk coverage (e.g., harms to data subjects) and look for tailored documentation proportional to organisation size. |
| 2314.1 – (MOD 000447) (L0–L3) | Documented GDPR processes. | GDPR policy/procedure documents. | Evidence should show practical implementation, such as sample consent forms and rights handling procedures. |
| 2314.2 – (MOD 000446) (L0–L3) | Conducting DPIAs for high-risk processing. | Completed DPIAs (latest two versions); risk register excerpts. | Micro-organisations may provide brief assessments; larger ones need detailed reports with mitigations. Assessors look for methodologies and stakeholder input. |
| 2500 – Resilient Networks and Systems (L0–L3) | Risk-assessed networks/systems demonstrating resilience to threats. | Latest two risk assessments; network diagrams; basic resilience policy. | Evidence shows tailored risks, current diagrams, and mitigations such as backups. History demonstrates ongoing commitment. |

### Notes for Implementation

- **Tailoring to Scale:** Evidence should scale with organisational size—micro-organisations may supply concise documents, whereas larger enterprises should provide comprehensive registers, logs, and audited reports.
- **Version Control:** Maintain version histories for policies and diagrams to demonstrate regular review and updates, especially from Level 1 onward.
- **Cumulative Requirements:** Each level builds on the previous ones. Ensure previous evidence is revisited and updated as part of higher-level submissions.
- **Automation Emphasis:** Level 2 and Level 3 require demonstrable automation and integration (e.g., automated inventories, SIEM feeds). Screenshots, tool exports, or live demonstrations can provide compelling evidence.
- **Testing and Assurance:** Maintain logs of tests, drills, and assurance activities. Be prepared to show how findings lead to remediation and how lessons learned feed back into policies and risk registers.
