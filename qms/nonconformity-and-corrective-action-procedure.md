## Procedure
1. **Detection and Containment**

   - Decide disposition: rework, repair, use-as-is (with approval), or scrap/withdraw.
3. **Root-Cause Analysis**

4. **Corrective Action Planning**
   - Define actions, owners, due dates, and verification steps using the *Corrective Action Plan* template.
   - Obtain Director approval for plans before implementation.
5. **Implementation and Verification**
   - Execute actions, update affected documents or controls, and communicate changes.
   - Verify effectiveness using the *Effectiveness Check* template; escalate if issues persist.
6. **Closure and Learning**
   - Close records when evidence shows the nonconformity is resolved and effectiveness is confirmed.
   - Capture lessons learned and feed into risk assessments, training, and management reviews.

## Records and Retention
- Nonconformity reports, root-cause analyses, corrective action plans, and effectiveness checks are retained for at least six years after closure.
