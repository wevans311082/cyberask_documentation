# Quality Manual

## Scope
- Quality Management System (QMS) covering consulting and advisory services delivered by Cyber Ask Ltd, including service design, delivery, and continual improvement activities.
- Applicable to all personnel, contractors, and suppliers who contribute to service delivery, data handling, or customer experience.
- Excludes services delivered entirely by third parties where Cyber Ask Ltd has no operational control, though due diligence and oversight remain in scope.

## Organizational Context
- A lean operating model with one Director who also fulfils governance, risk management, HR, and IT administration duties.
- Reliance on Microsoft 365 services and a single Windows Server domain controller synchronized with Microsoft Entra ID.
- Customer engagements vary from short advisory tasks to recurring managed services, with deliverables typically governed by contract-specific statements of work.
- Risk posture aligns with ISO 9001 principles and integrates with information security controls derived from ISO/IEC 27001 and Cyber Essentials where applicable.

## Interested Parties and Needs
- **Customers:** Reliable delivery, accurate advice, timely reporting, responsiveness to feedback, and protection of confidential information.
- **Regulators and Legal Authorities:** Compliance with UK legislation, data protection requirements, and contractual obligations.
- **Suppliers and Partners:** Clear requirements, timely payment, and defined responsibilities when supporting delivery.
- **Internal Roles:** Director and any contracted specialists require defined processes, authority, and criteria for accepting or rejecting work products.

## Process Interactions and Interfaces
- Proposal and contract management provide inputs (requirements, scope, acceptance criteria) to service delivery and project execution.
- Service delivery produces customer outcomes and evidence for performance reporting, feeding metrics to management review.
- Risk management informs project planning, change control, and improvement actions; outputs include treatment plans and updates to controls.
- Customer feedback and issue management capture inputs that drive corrective actions, knowledge updates, and service improvements.
- Document control maintains controlled templates and records, ensuring versioned outputs for audits and customer assurance.

## Roles, Responsibilities, and Authority
- **Director:** Owns the QMS, approves policies, sets quality objectives, allocates resources, and has authority to stop or change work that jeopardises quality or compliance.
- **Project/Service Leads (may be fulfilled by the Director):** Plan and deliver engagements, ensure adherence to processes, and maintain records of outputs and customer communications.
- **Specialist Contractors:** Execute assigned tasks according to documented procedures and report nonconformities or risks promptly.
- **All Personnel:** Follow applicable policies, contribute to continual improvement by raising issues or opportunities, and participate in reviews as requested.

## Continual Improvement and Review
