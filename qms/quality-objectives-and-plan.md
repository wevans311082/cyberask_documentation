# Quality Objectives and Plan

The Director sets and monitors these objectives. Progress is reviewed quarterly and at the annual management review.

| Objective | KPI | Owner | Target | Review Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Deliver engagements on time | Percentage of deliverables accepted by customers on or before committed dates | Director / Project Lead | ≥ 95% on-time acceptance each quarter | Quarterly status review and annual management review |
| Maintain customer satisfaction | Average post-engagement satisfaction score (1–5 scale) | Director | ≥ 4.5 average score with no single score below 4 without corrective action | After each engagement and consolidated quarterly |
| Reduce rework and nonconformities | Number of corrective actions arising from customer feedback or internal reviews | Director / Project Lead | ≤ 2 corrective actions per quarter, with 100% actions closed by next review | Tracked monthly; summarised quarterly |
| Strengthen knowledge management | Percentage of completed engagements with lessons learned recorded | Director / Project Lead | ≥ 90% engagements have documented lessons learned | Monthly check and quarterly roll-up |
| Improve proposal accuracy | Ratio of planned effort to actual effort (variance) for scoped engagements | Director | Maintain within ±10% variance across rolling three-month period | Monthly variance review |

## Action and Follow-Up
- Owners document action plans for any objective that misses its target, including root cause, planned remediation, and due dates.
- KPI results and corrective actions are recorded in management review minutes and shared with relevant stakeholders.
- The Director is responsible for verifying the effectiveness of completed actions before closure.
