# Quality Objectives and Plan

The Director sets and monitors these objectives. Progress is reviewed quarterly and at the annual management review. Data sources include the *Service Delivery Record*, *Audit Report*, customer surveys, and project tracking tools. Results and actions are captured in the *Management Review Minutes* template.

## Action and Follow-Up
- Owners document action plans for any objective that misses its target, including root cause, planned remediation, and due dates.
- KPI results and corrective actions are recorded in management review minutes and shared with relevant stakeholders.
- The Director is responsible for verifying the effectiveness of completed actions before closure.
