**Company:** Cyber Ask Ltd (CYBER ASK LTD), Registered No. 15113248  
**Author:** WEvans Director

## Purpose
This policy establishes requirements for regulatory and legal compliance to protect organizational assets and ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations.

## Scope
This policy applies to all employees, contractors, and third parties who access or manage company resources related to regulatory and legal compliance.

## Policy

### Regulatory Landscape
- The company maintains a register of applicable laws and regulations including, but not limited to, the UK Data Protection Act 2018, UK GDPR, Computer Misuse Act 1990, PCI DSS, and relevant industry guidance from the FCA and NCSC.
- Each regulation within the register is assigned an owner responsible for monitoring changes and ensuring that business processes remain compliant.

### Compliance Management
- A Data Protection Officer (DPO) oversees adherence to privacy legislation and coordinates responses to data subject requests in line with the [Records of Processing Policy](records-of-processing-policy.md) and the [Data Protection and Privacy Policy](../cyber-security/data-protection-and-privacy-policy.md).
- Compliance obligations are reviewed quarterly. Evidence such as audit reports, training records, and contracts are stored in the compliance management system for a minimum of six years.
- Significant regulatory changes trigger a risk assessment and updates to affected policies and procedures via the Change Management process.
- Third parties providing services on behalf of the company must evidence compliance with applicable laws through contractual clauses and regular attestations.

### Reporting and Escalation
- Suspected legal or regulatory breaches must be reported to the Compliance Manager within one business day.
- Non-compliance issues are logged in the ticketing system, assigned to control owners, and tracked until closure.
- Serious breaches are escalated to the board and, where required, reported to the Information Commissionerâ€™s Office within 72 hours.

## Technical Controls
- Compliance management tools track regulatory obligations, map them to controls, and produce audit-ready evidence.
- Access to compliance records is restricted based on least privilege and protected with multi-factor authentication.
- Automated alerts notify the Compliance Manager when regulatory deadlines or contract renewals approach.
