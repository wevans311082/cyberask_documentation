# Access Control Policy

This policy establishes requirements for granting, reviewing, and revoking access to information systems so that only authorized individuals perform approved activities. The policy supports CE/CE+ and ISO 27001 control objectives.

## Purpose
Ensure access to company resources is limited to legitimate business needs and aligned with the principle of least privilege.

## Scope
All employees, contractors, and systems that store or process company information.

## Policy
- **Account Provisioning:** Managers submit access requests; IT assigns unique user IDs and records approvals.
- **Access Reviews:** Managers review user access at least quarterly and confirm ongoing need.
- **Access Revocation:** HR notifies IT of role changes; IT disables accounts within one business day of departure.
- **Privileged Access:** Administrative accounts require multi-factor authentication and are logged for audit.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- **IT:** Implements access controls and maintains audit logs.
- **Managers:** Approve access and perform periodic reviews.
- **HR:** Communicates staffing changes that affect access.

## Compliance and Review
Violations may result in disciplinary action. This policy is reviewed annually or upon significant system changes.
