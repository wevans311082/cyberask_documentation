# Vulnerability Management Policy

**Company:** Cyber Ask Ltd (CYBER ASK LTD), Registered No. 15113248  
**Author:** WEvans Director

This policy describes how the organization identifies, evaluates, prioritizes, and remediates security vulnerabilities in support of CE/CE+ and ISO/IEC 27001 control objectives. Effective vulnerability management reduces the likelihood of exploitation and ensures the continued protection of information assets.

## Cyber Ask Operating Context

1. Cyber Ask Ltd operates with a single employee who also serves as the sole director responsible for governance, risk, and compliance decisions.
2. Cyber Ask Ltd maintains professional liability insurance covering its consulting and advisory services.
3. A dedicated virtual machine functions as the single Windows Server domain controller and is synchronized with Microsoft Entra ID for identity management.
4. The organisation holds a standard Microsoft 365 licence; Microsoft Purview and Microsoft Defender add-ons are not deployed, and Windows Defender provides endpoint protection.
5. Customer data is stored on BitLocker-encrypted drives to protect information at rest.
6. Cyber Ask Ltd assets are vulnerability-assessed weekly and patched promptly according to remediation guidance.
7. Cyber Ask Ltd has not yet achieved Cyber Essentials, Cyber Essentials Plus, or ISO 27001 certification but aligns its controls with those standards where practicable.
8. The Director personally fulfils HR, IT administration, and compliance duties, engaging specialist suppliers when additional expertise is required.



## Purpose

Reduce risk by systematically managing vulnerabilities in hardware, software, services, and third-party components. The policy provides a framework for continuous identification and remediation of weaknesses before they can be exploited.

## Scope

This policy applies to all systems owned, leased, or operated by the organization, including on-premises infrastructure, cloud environments, mobile devices, applications, and network-connected devices. Third-party providers processing company data must maintain comparable vulnerability management practices.

## Definitions

1. **Vulnerability:** A weakness in a system that could be exploited to compromise confidentiality, integrity, or availability.
2. **Patch:** A code change designed to fix a vulnerability or improve system security.
3. **Zero-Day Vulnerability:** A previously unknown vulnerability for which no patch is currently available.

## Policy Statements

1. **Scanning and Discovery**
   1. Perform authenticated vulnerability scans of production systems at least monthly and after significant changes.
   2. External-facing systems shall be scanned weekly using Tenable Nessus and Microsoft Defender for Cloud.
   3. Container images and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates are scanned during the build pipeline with GitHub Advanced Security.
   4. Use multiple scanning tools where appropriate to ensure coverage of different platforms and technologies.

2. **Assessment and Prioritization**
   1. Rate findings based on severity (e.g., CVSS score), exploitability, and business impact.
   2. Maintain an asset inventory to associate vulnerabilities with system owners and criticality levels.

3. **Remediation Timeframes**
   1. Critical vulnerabilities must be remediated within 14 days; high within 30 days; medium within 90 days; low within 180 days.
   2. Where remediation is not possible within required timeframes, mitigating controls must be implemented and documented.

4. **Patch Management**
   1. Apply vendor-supplied patches and updates in accordance with change management procedures.
   2. Test patches in a controlled environment before deployment to production systems.
   3. Detailed patching workflows and maintenance windows are defined in the [Patch and Vulnerability Management Policy](patch-and-vulnerability-management-policy.md).

5. **Configuration Management**
   1. Use secure baseline configurations and automated tools to detect unauthorized changes.
   2. Harden systems based on industry benchmarks (e.g., CIS Benchmarks) and document deviations.

6. **Verification and Closure**
   1. Re-scan systems after remediation to confirm vulnerabilities are resolved.
   2. Maintain records of remediation actions, including dates and responsible personnel.

7. **Exception Management**
   1. Document and approve deviations with compensating controls. Exceptions must include justification, risk assessment, and expiration date.

8. **Zero-Day Response**
   1. Upon discovery of a zero-day vulnerability, assess exposure, apply temporary mitigations, and track vendor updates for permanent remediation.

9. **Vulnerability Disclosure Program**
   1. The organization maintains a responsible disclosure program to encourage external researchers to report vulnerabilities.
   2. Reports from external parties must be acknowledged within five business days, and findings triaged according to this policy.

10. **Tools and Automation**

1. Approved scanning tools and configuration management databases (CMDB) shall be used to automate discovery and tracking of vulnerabilities.
2. Findings are recorded in the Jira ticketing system and linked to corresponding assets in the CMDB.
3. Tool configurations must be reviewed annually to ensure accuracy and coverage.

11. **Documentation and Record Keeping**

1. All vulnerability findings, remediation actions, and exception approvals must be documented in the ticketing system.
2. Records shall be retained for at least five years to support audits and compliance requirements.

12. **Security Testing Integration**

1. Results from penetration tests, code reviews, and security assessments shall feed into the vulnerability management process.
2. Vulnerabilities identified through testing are subject to the same remediation timeframes and reporting requirements as scan findings.

13. **Policy Enforcement**

1. Failure to remediate vulnerabilities within required timeframes may result in escalation to senior management and could impact project approvals or system certifications.

## Roles and Responsibilities

1. **Security Team:** Oversees scanning, assessment, and tracking of remediation efforts; maintains vulnerability management tools; and reports metrics to management.
2. **System Owners and Administrators:** Apply patches, configuration changes, and mitigations within defined timeframes; ensure accurate asset inventories.
3. **Management:** Approves remediation timelines and exceptions, allocates resources, and enforces accountability.
4. **Third-Party Providers:** Address vulnerabilities in systems under their control and provide evidence of remediation upon request.

## Accountable Roles and Decision Authority

1. **Director:** Owns and maintains this policy, coordinates updates, and ensures alignment with the Cyber Governance Policy and Document Control Policy.
2. **Director (Risk Owner):** Reviews and approves exceptions, risk acceptances, and material control changes, documenting rationale in line with the Risk Management Policy.
3. **Director (Service Owner):** Oversees day-to-day execution of this policy, vendor engagement, and customer communications when actions affect external parties.


## Metrics and Reporting

1. Monthly reports summarizing open vulnerabilities, remediation status, and overdue items are provided to management.
2. Trends in vulnerability counts and remediation times shall be analyzed quarterly to identify systemic issues.

## Training and Awareness

1. Administrators must receive training on secure configuration practices and vulnerability remediation procedures.
2. Security awareness programs shall highlight the importance of timely patching and reporting of suspected vulnerabilities.
3. New employees working with technical systems must complete vulnerability management training within 30 days of hire.

## Review and Continuous Improvement

This policy is reviewed annually and whenever significant infrastructure or regulatory changes occur. Lessons learned from incidents or audits will be incorporated to improve the vulnerability management process.

## Implementation Guidelines
1. The Director records policy-related approvals and evidence in the central document repository and retains them for audit purposes.
2. BitLocker-encrypted storage protects customer data on company systems, and Windows Defender telemetry is reviewed weekly.
3. Weekly vulnerability scans and monthly patch reviews are led by the Director, with remediation actions tracked to completion.
4. Microsoft 365 security settings rely on features provided within the standard licence; compensating controls are documented when advanced tooling is unavailable.
5. Exceptions require written approval from the Director, including compensating controls and a defined review date.
