## Zero Trust Pillars in Practice

The Cyber Ask zero-trust programme is structured around three core pillars: Verify Explicitly, Enforce Least Privilege, and Assume Breach. Each pillar is supported by technology controls, operational procedures, and continuous improvement cycles.

### Verify Explicitly

- **Identity Assurance:** Every access request must be authenticated using phishing-resistant methods (FIDO2 hardware keys, certificate-based auth) coupled with conditional access policies. Device posture, geolocation, time-of-day, and behavioural risk scores inform allow/deny decisions.
- **Continuous Validation:** Session re-evaluation occurs whenever context changesâ€”new device, unusual network, privilege escalation, or anomalous behaviour. Microsoft Entra ID Conditional Access and BeyondCorp-inspired proxies enforce re-authentication and step-up checks.
- **Telemetry Integration:** Authentication, network, endpoint, and SaaS logs feed into the central SIEM (e.g., Splunk, Microsoft Sentinel). Automated correlations flag access anomalies such as impossible travel, excessive privilege activation, and abnormal API usage.

### Enforce Least Privilege

- **Dynamic RBAC and ABAC:** Access entitlements are calculated based on role, attributes (department, project, device compliance), and sensitivity of requested resources. Privileges are granted just-in-time, expire automatically, and require renewal with documented justification.
- **Micro-Segmentation:** Network segmentation is enforced using VMware NSX or Illumio to create granular policy zones. For example, consulting project environments are isolated from corporate services, and east-west traffic is restricted to approved application flows.
- **Data-Centric Controls:** Data loss prevention (DLP) and information protection labels define who can access, modify, or share sensitive documents. Encryption keys are scoped to business units, preventing lateral access even within the same domain.

### Assume Breach

- **Threat Hunting:** Analysts proactively search for indicators of compromise across identity, endpoint, and cloud telemetry. Hunt queries run weekly and include behavioural analytics to detect stealthy adversaries.
- **Resilience Engineering:** Incident response playbooks emphasise rapid containment, forensic readiness, and service restoration. Backup systems are segmented and protected by immutable storage to mitigate ransomware threats.
- **Red Team Exercises:** Annual red/purple team engagements test zero-trust controls, focusing on bypass attempts and privilege escalation. Findings drive improvements in detection rules and automation scripts.

## Micro-Segmentation Blueprint

Micro-segmentation divides the network into isolated trust zones to limit lateral movement. Cyber Ask deploys the following approach:

1. **Zone Classification:** Assets are categorised into zones: Identity Services, Core Productivity, Client Deliverables, Development/Test, and Management Plane. Each zone has defined ingress/egress policies.
2. **Policy Definition:** Using NSX distributed firewalls, policies are written in plain language (e.g., "Allow HTTPS from Compliance Workstations to Case Management App"). Illumio labels support workload-based enforcement for hybrid environments.
3. **Enforcement Mechanics:** Traffic flows are monitored in discovery mode before enforcement to understand dependencies. Once baselines are established, default-deny rules block unapproved flows.
4. **Change Management:** Policy changes require risk assessments, peer review, and testing in a staging environment. Automated compliance checks validate that segmentation rules align with CIS benchmarks and regulatory obligations.
5. **Visibility:** NSX Intelligence dashboards and Illumio Explorer provide heatmaps of traffic patterns. Anomalies, such as unexpected RDP traffic between zones, trigger alerts and incident response procedures.

## Behavioural Analytics and SIEM Integration

Behavioural analytics provide continuous verification of user and entity behaviour. The SIEM aggregates telemetry from identity providers, endpoints, network sensors, and SaaS APIs.

- **Data Sources:** Microsoft 365 audit logs, Okta/BeyondCorp access data, EDR telemetry, DNS logs, firewall events, and CASB alerts feed into Splunk or Sentinel.
- **Machine Learning Models:** UEBA (User and Entity Behaviour Analytics) models establish baselines for login frequency, file access volumes, and data transfer rates. Deviations generate risk scores and automated containment actions (e.g., temporary session suspension).
- **Sample Splunk Queries:**
  - Detect suspicious OAuth consent grants:
    ```spl
    index=o365 sourcetype="o365:management" Workload="AzureActiveDirectory" Operation="Consent to application"
    | stats count by UserId, AppId
    | where count > 2
    ```
  - Flag anomalous data exfiltration:
    ```spl
    index=proxy_logs action=allowed
    | stats sum(bytes_out) as total_out by user, dest_domain
    | where total_out > 5*avg(total_out) by user
    ```
- **Automated Response:** SOAR workflows isolate devices, revoke tokens, or prompt MFA challenges when high-risk scores are detected. Alerts integrate with the incident response process for triage and remediation.

## Implementation Roadmap and Risk Heatmap

Zero-trust adoption progresses through phased implementation. Each phase evaluates residual risk levels and control maturity.

| Phase | Description | Key Activities | Risk Level (Pre-Control) | Residual Risk (Post-Control) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Phase 1: Foundation | Establish identity-centric controls. | Enforce phishing-resistant MFA, inventory assets, deploy conditional access. | High | Medium |
| Phase 2: Visibility | Gain holistic telemetry and classify assets. | Integrate SIEM, deploy NSX/Illumio sensors, map data flows. | High | Medium |
| Phase 3: Enforcement | Apply micro-segmentation and least privilege. | Implement zone policies, PIM, DLP, and just-in-time access. | Medium | Low |
| Phase 4: Automation | Automate response and continuous validation. | Deploy SOAR runbooks, UEBA-driven containment, automated compliance checks. | Medium | Low |
| Phase 5: Optimisation | Continuous improvement and resilience. | Conduct red-team exercises, refine analytics models, update playbooks. | Medium | Very Low |

Residual risk values are reviewed quarterly and after major changes to validate that controls remain effective and aligned with business priorities.

## Governance and Accountability

- The Director serves as Zero Trust Programme Owner, chairing monthly steering meetings to review metrics, risk register entries, and project milestones.
- A cross-functional working group (security, IT, legal, client services) assesses new technology requests for zero-trust alignment before procurement.
- Exceptions to zero-trust mandates require a documented business justification, compensating controls, and an expiration date not exceeding 90 days.
- Third-party vendors must demonstrate equivalent zero-trust controls through due diligence questionnaires and contractual clauses.

## Metrics and Continuous Improvement

Key performance indicators demonstrate programme effectiveness:

- Percentage of applications protected by conditional access and micro-segmentation.
- Time to revoke compromised credentials detected via UEBA alerts.
- Number of lateral movement attempts blocked by NSX/Illumio policies.
- Coverage of automated response playbooks (measured by incidents resolved without manual intervention).
- Training completion rates for zero-trust awareness modules.

Findings inform quarterly improvement plans and budget allocations. Lessons learned from incidents or exercises drive updates to control objectives and technology investments.

## Training and Culture

Zero trust success depends on user behaviour. The organisation delivers multi-layered education:

- **Foundational Modules:** Introduce zero-trust concepts, emphasising the move away from perimeter-based thinking.
- **Role-Based Labs:** Administrators practice configuring conditional access, micro-segmentation policies, and Splunk queries in sandbox environments.
- **Executive Briefings:** Highlight business benefits, compliance outcomes, and investment requirements.
- **Tabletop Exercises:** Simulate breach scenarios to reinforce assume-breach mindset and validate cross-team coordination.

Training attendance is tracked via the learning management system, and completion is required for system access privileges.

## Integration with Broader Security Frameworks

Zero-trust controls complement other enterprise policies:

- **Access Control Policy:** Provides RBAC foundations and provisioning workflows consumed by zero-trust enforcement mechanisms.
- **Incident Response Policy and Plan:** Define escalation paths when zero-trust analytics detect anomalies.
- **Passwordless and MFA Policies:** Supply the identity assurance capabilities necessary for verify-explicitly controls.
- **Cloud and API Security Policies:** Extend zero-trust principles to infrastructure-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service, and API ecosystems.

Cross-references ensure consistent control implementation and facilitate audits.
