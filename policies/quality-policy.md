# Quality Policy

Cyber Ask Ltd is committed to delivering consulting and advisory services that meet or exceed customer expectations while complying with applicable legal, regulatory, and contractual requirements.

To achieve this, the Director commits to:
- Maintain a documented Quality Management System that aligns with ISO 9001 principles and integrates with related security and risk controls, using controlled procedures and templates referenced in the Policy Index.
- Focus on customer needs by ensuring requirements are clearly defined, agreed, and verified before acceptance.
- Comply with all applicable statutory, regulatory, and contractual obligations governing services, data protection, and confidentiality.
- Drive continual improvement through management review, corrective actions, and updates to objectives, processes, and training, ensuring outputs are captured in controlled forms (e.g., management review minutes, corrective action plans, and effectiveness checks).
- Provide adequate resources, competencies, and tools to deliver services consistently and effectively, including onboarding of competent suppliers where required.
- Empower the Director, as the authorised representative of top management, with the authority to approve quality objectives, halt activities that threaten quality or compliance, and allocate resources to address issues promptly.

This policy is reviewed at least annually or following significant changes to services, customer requirements, or applicable regulations.
