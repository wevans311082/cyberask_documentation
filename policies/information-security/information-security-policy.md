# Information Security Policy

**Company:** Cyber Ask Ltd (CYBER ASK LTD), Registered No. 15113248  
**Author:** Wayne Evans (Director)

This policy defines the organisation's overarching approach to managing information security risks, meeting regulatory commitments, and maintaining compliance with ISO/IEC 27001:2022, the NCSC Cyber Assessment Framework, and applicable data protection legislation.

## Cyber Ask Operating Context

1. Cyber Ask Ltd operates with a single employee who also serves as the sole director responsible for governance, risk, and compliance decisions.
2. Cyber Ask Ltd maintains professional liability insurance covering its consulting and advisory services.
3. A dedicated virtual machine functions as the single Windows Server domain controller and is synchronised with Microsoft Entra ID for identity management.
4. The organisation holds a standard Microsoft 365 licence; Microsoft Purview and Microsoft Defender add-ons are not deployed, and Windows Defender provides endpoint protection.
5. Customer data is stored on BitLocker-encrypted drives to protect information at rest.
6. Cyber Ask Ltd assets are vulnerability-assessed weekly and patched promptly according to remediation guidance.
7. Cyber Ask Ltd has not yet achieved Cyber Essentials, Cyber Essentials Plus, or ISO/IEC 27001 certification but aligns its controls with those standards where practicable.
8. The Director personally fulfils HR, IT administration, and compliance duties, engaging specialist suppliers when additional expertise is required.

## Purpose

Protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets by establishing governance, control objectives, and reporting mechanisms that enable continual improvement of the Information Security Management System (ISMS).

## Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, suppliers, and third parties who access or process company information and to all information systems owned, leased, or managed by Cyber Ask Ltd.

## Information Security Objectives

Objectives are set using SMART criteria (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) and reviewed quarterly. Progress is tracked in the security metrics pack and escalated via management review meetings.

| Objective | Baseline (FY24) | Target | Measure | Owner | Review Cadence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Reduce the number of recorded security incidents | 5 incidents | 20% reduction year-on-year | Incident register trend analysis | Director (ISO) | Quarterly |
| Close 95% of risk treatment actions within agreed due dates | 78% | â‰¥95% by Q4 FY25 | Risk register workflow metrics | Director (Risk Owner) | Monthly |
| Increase completion of annual security awareness training | 60% | 100% by end of Q2 FY25 | LMS completion reports | Director (Service Owner) | Monthly |
| Maintain 100% coverage of critical assets in the asset inventory | 85% | 100% by Q3 FY25 | Asset inventory reconciliation | Director (ISO) | Monthly |
| Achieve compliance with customer contractual data protection clauses | New contracts | 100% adherence by contract go-live | Contract review checklist | Director (Service Owner) | Per engagement |

## Governance Model

1. Senior management endorses the ISMS, allocates resources, and approves objectives, policies, and treatment plans.
2. The Director (ISO) maintains the ISMS, ensures risk management integration, and reports performance metrics to stakeholders.
3. Security objectives are established, measured, and reviewed at least quarterly, with results captured in management review minutes.
4. Policies, procedures, and supporting documents are maintained under version control in the document management repository.
