**Company:** Cyber Ask Ltd (CYBER ASK LTD), Registered No. 15113248  
**Author:** WEvans Director

This document describes the systematic approach for identifying, analyzing, and evaluating information security risks in compliance with ISO 27001.

## Cyber Ask Operating Context

1. Cyber Ask Ltd operates with a single employee who also serves as the sole director responsible for governance, risk, and compliance decisions.
2. Cyber Ask Ltd maintains professional liability insurance covering its consulting and advisory services.
3. A dedicated virtual machine functions as the single Windows Server domain controller and is synchronized with Microsoft Entra ID for identity management.
4. The organisation holds a standard Microsoft 365 licence; Microsoft Purview and Microsoft Defender add-ons are not deployed, and Windows Defender provides endpoint protection.
5. Customer data is stored on BitLocker-encrypted drives to protect information at rest.
6. Cyber Ask Ltd assets are vulnerability-assessed weekly and patched promptly according to remediation guidance.
7. Cyber Ask Ltd has not yet achieved Cyber Essentials, Cyber Essentials Plus, or ISO 27001 certification but aligns its controls with those standards where practicable.
8. The Director personally fulfils HR, IT administration, and compliance duties, engaging specialist suppliers when additional expertise is required.



## Method

1. **Asset Identification:** Compile an inventory of information assets, owners, and locations.
2. **Threat and Vulnerability Identification:** Determine potential threats and vulnerabilities for each asset.
3. **Risk Analysis:** Evaluate likelihood and impact using a qualitative scale of Low, Medium, High.
4. **Risk Evaluation:** Compare risks against predefined acceptance criteria to prioritize treatment.

## Frequency

## Accountable Roles and Decision Authority

1. **Director:** Owns and maintains this policy, coordinates updates, and ensures alignment with the Cyber Governance Policy and Document Control Policy.
