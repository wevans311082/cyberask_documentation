# cyberask_documentation

A Markdown-based company policy and document set.

This repository contains placeholder policies for HR, cyber security, information security, and legal NDAs. Each document is drafted to support CE/CE+ and ISO 27001 compliance.

- Explore the `policies/` directory for detailed policies and guidance.
- Visit the `templates/` directory for ready-to-use forms covering DPIAs, records of processing, asset inventories, risk assessments, NDAs, contracts, and security incident documentation.

> Duplicate a template before editing so the originals remain reusable for future engagements.
