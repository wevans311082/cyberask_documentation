# cyberask_documentation

A Markdown-based company policy and document set.

This repository contains placeholder policies for HR, cyber security, information security, quality management, and legal NDAs. Each document is drafted to support CE/CE+ and ISO 27001 compliance.

- Explore the `policies/` directory for detailed policies and guidance, including the [Quality Policy](policies/quality-policy.md).
- Visit the `qms/` directory for the [Quality Manual](qms/quality-manual.md), [Quality Objectives and Plan](qms/quality-objectives-and-plan.md), and [Process Map](qms/process-map.md) that describe scope, governance, and core interactions of the Quality Management System.
- Visit the `templates/` directory for ready-to-use forms covering DPIAs, records of processing, asset inventories, risk assessments, NDAs, contracts, and security incident documentation.

> Duplicate a template before editing so the originals remain reusable for future engagements.
